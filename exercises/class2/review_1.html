    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>The use of different, dark contrasting colors seemed unconventional at first but it does match the vintage aesthetic that they are trying to achieve.</p>

    <h4>Usability</h4>
    <p>Though the horizontal slide for the release section under Home page is innovative, the lack of icons (ie arrows) might prove difficult for non tech savvy and your friendly neighborhood grandmas.</p>

    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>Contents are neatly organized, though the recurrent font, the black texts on yellow background overshadow the emphasis on headings.
    </p>

    <h4>Creativity</h4>
    <p>The website has demonstrated its originality through striking color palette, good text placement and good use of image filters.
