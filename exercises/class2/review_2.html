    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>Minimal color palettes and design is effective though common and thus not outstanding.</p>

    <h4>Usability</h4>
    <p>3D rendering may not work well on lower end computers and there is no indication to scroll in order to continue the animation.
    </p>

    <h4>Content</h4>
    <p>The website does not feature any content as of now except for the apeâ€™s walking animation in different outfits,colors from various camera angles. 
    </p>

    <h4>Creativity</h4>
    <p>The use of the scroll function to dictate camera angle is quite creative.</p>
