        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>This websiteâ€™s approach to creative text layout is beautifully done though the minimal black/white design is over done in my view.</p>

        <h4>Usability</h4>
        <p>Clear structure though the extremely small font size could be hard to read for people with poor vision.  </p>
    
        <h4>Content</h4>
        <p>Although the processes for each highlighted work could be more elaborated, their design in mockups and in electronic devices do help users to visualize them.
        </p>
    
        <h4>Creativity</h4>
        <p>The unconventional placement of the nav bar in the middle of the website works unexpectedly well.</p>
